I love using the PHP Framework Laravel. There’s hardly a day as a web developer that I’m not doing something in Laravel. I also love using the javascript framework React. But for some reason, the Laravel community is hot on VueJS. I’m not sure why, and I’ve got nothing against it (I still use plenty of Vue), but I’ve definitely found the resources for getting new users up to speed on using Laravel with React to be, well, somewhat lacking. Where’s the Laravel React Training?
So with that, I’m bringing two things back to these communities to hopefully remedy that a bit. The first, is a light but batteries-included app starter kit for React and Laravel at [https://github.com/figoli-quinn/laravel-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/figoli-quinn/laravel-react-boilerplate). I’ll go into it more in detail in a later post but the short description is that you can clone this repository and quickly be up and running with a Laravel + React monolith app that has user login, registration, password resets, and testing out of the box.
The second, is a training series creating a fictional app called Tooter (creative, right?) that allows users to toot their ideas out into the world for others to see. In this, we’ll go over:

* Laravel as an API
* Building React SPAs
* Testing
* Integration / building a React Native app

One thing to note is that this will not be diving into scaling this to a fully fledged massive production app. We’ll be going over best practices and do our best to not introduce inefficient code, but this won’t be going over things like serverless, CDNs, etc. This training series should get you up to speed on everything you need to build SPAs and Native apps using Laravel and React(Native). Pretty cool, right? I’ll be releasing that training series over time so be sure to bookmark this and check back often.
