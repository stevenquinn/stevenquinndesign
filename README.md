# Stevenquinndesign

This is the source code for https://stevenquinndesign.com, my blog! It's using the Gatsby blog starter, which is a great way to get started with Gatsby. This also includes Tailwind CSS, which is a great utility-first CSS framework.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repo and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone
cd stevenquinndesign
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run develop
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) with your browser to see the result.
